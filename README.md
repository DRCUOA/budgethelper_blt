# Personal Budget Tracker - A Complete Guide

## What is this app?

This is a personal budget tracking application that helps you manage your money. Think of it as your digital financial diary where you can:
- Track your income and expenses
- See where your money goes with beautiful charts
- Import your bank statements
- Get insights about your spending habits

## How does it work?

### For Users
1. Create an account with your email
2. Add your income (salary, freelance work, etc.)
3. Record your expenses (rent, groceries, etc.)
4. Import transactions from your bank's CSV files
5. View charts and reports about your spending
6. Track your savings progress

### Under the Hood
The app is split into two main parts:

#### Frontend (What you see)
- Built with Vue 3 (a modern JavaScript framework)
- Uses Pinia for managing data across screens
- Shows beautiful charts with Chart.js
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean look

#### Backend (The engine)
- Runs on Node.js with Express
- Uses SQLite database (perfect for personal projects)
- Handles user accounts and data securely
- Processes CSV imports
